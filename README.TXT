This program is a fun text based single player battleship game with a random guessing AI, written in Java.

The program creates two boards, the size of which is determined by the player.
One board is for the AI and the other is for the human player.
The AI randomly places 3 1x1 ships. The player is asked to select the location of his 3 ships.
The game commences with a AI guess, then the boards are displayed, showing where has been guessed and where hasn't.
The player them selcts his guess of the ships. The guessing continues until all three ships are destroyed on either side.
The player who first loses all 3 ships is the loser
